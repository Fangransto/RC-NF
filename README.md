# RC-NF: Reservoir Computing with Normalizing Flow

* The folder "nolitsa" is used to calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We refer to the [NoLiTSA](https://github.com/manu-mannattil/nolitsa "NoLiTSA") open source library.
* The folder "src" involves RC (`RC.py`), ESC (`ESC.py`), and NF (`flows.py` `models.py` `utls.py`).
